# The Mazinator 3000
A 3D maze game I made for my Game Mechanics class in Unity. It's still a work in progress.

# The Concept
Complete the maze! 

To complete the maze, you have to collect a certain amount of coins to unlock the gate to victory! But all the coins on your maze are for another maze, and the ones you need are on that same other maze... That's why you have the ability to flip gravity: to get to that other maze! To make matters worse, you have to complete both mazes to win the game.

# The Controls
WASD to move forward, left, backward, right, respectively
Q,E to rotate left, rightm respectively
SPACE to jump
F to change gravity

# Things needing work
- The victory condition
- A reason to play this game
- Tweaking of amount of coins needed to play the game
- Possible reworking of the mazes
- Add sounds
- possibly other things I don't remember right now.
